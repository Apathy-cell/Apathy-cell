- 👋 Hi, I’m Kristina Stauffer-@Apathy-cell
- 👀 I’m interested in software security development, pen testing, and ethical hacking.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Advanced Software Engineering at Full Sail University. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my new project CareAlert Lite.
- 📫 How to reach me: KAStauffer@student.fullsail.edu  
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: In my free time or to blow off steam I like to practice aerial silks and aerial lyra (hoop). Not only is it great strength training, but
-     it keeps my adrenaline pumping sometimes.
- Another fun fact: This project was inspired due to the lack of options we have for seniors who are low income and choose to age at home, such as my mother.
- She is a serious fall risk, and after inplementing a camera into her home, and trying to figure out a way to be notified if she was not doing okay due to her
- health failing, my capstone project gave me the perfect opportunity to brainstorm an idea that I think may help millions of seniors and bring relief to there loved
- ones.
- Stay tuned!!!!
